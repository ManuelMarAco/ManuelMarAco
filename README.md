---A first look into me and my work---

ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Manuel, a programming student from Spain that is currently in their first year of web development.

ðŸŽ­
I have great skills in improvisation, creative thinking and inner-team communication.
I haven't done any programming prior, but I'm eager to start. I'm currently learning Java, HTML, XML+DTD, Bootstrap and SQL.
I also have an amateur background on tabletop game design, simple robot commands and general problem resolution.
My prefered pronouns are they/them, although I go by any.

ðŸ“§
If you would like to contact me I'm available at martinacostamanuel.tramites@gmail.com, but my mindful I may not check my inbox frequently.
